# hello-world
Uhm, an irrelevant repository.

Hello, this is another irrelevant repository that would mostly waste your time if you want to read it.

I love everything that I can eat & tastes good.
I love cats and some other animals too.
I hate bugs.

Currently at a university studying Robotics & Mechatronics engineering, for my Bachelor's Degree. So I'm doing mostly boring C++ programming, things about microcontrollers, etc.

Thanks & good bye. Have a nice day.
